# Spring Boot: just 4 beans for implementing a default JDBC Authentication with SecurityFilterChain-based Configuration

## Short Description


This project is a pure REST API demo, exposing just a couple of protected endpoints. It is based on Java version 17, and the latest releases of Spring Boot 3.2.1 (announced on DECEMBER 19, 2023) and Spring Security 6.2.1 (announced on DECEMBER 21, 2023). It shows the 4 very basic beans required for the default JDBC-based Authentication for implementing a fundamental custom security configuration class based on the SecurityFilterChain. 
You can use it as a base repo for further customizations.
